## Key Projects

* **Bitcoin Price Forecasting with ARIMA :**
Built a rolling ARIMA(10,1,0) model to forecast Bitcoin prices using historical data.

*Tools Used*: Python (pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib), ARIMA, MSE

*Approach*: Cleaned and sorted raw BTC prices, trained ARIMA on a walk-forward loop, and evaluated against test data.

*Outcome*: Achieved a Test MSE of 32,409.63; model captured key price trends and volatility shifts across time.

* **COVID-19 Data Exploration with SQL :**
Performed in-depth analysis of global COVID-19 trends using SQL, focusing on cases, deaths, and vaccination progress.

*Tools Used*: SQL (Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, Window Functions), SQL Server

*Approach*: Analyzed total cases vs deaths, infection rate vs population, and vaccination coverage using aggregated queries and partitioned calculations.

*Outcome*: Identified top countries by infection and death rate, calculated vaccination rollout percentage, and created reusable views for BI visualization.

* **Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression:**
Built a fraud detection system using logistic regression to classify credit card transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

*Tools Used*: Python (pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib), Logistic Regression

*Approach*: Cleaned and balanced the dataset using under-sampling, visualized feature correlations, and trained a binary classification model with 80/20 train-test split.

*Outcome*: Achieved **94.4% accuracy** on the test set; demonstrated the ability to handle imbalanced data and build real-time fraud detection logic.

* **Retail Data ETL Pipeline with Python & SQLite:**
Built a lightweight ETL pipeline to extract retail transaction data, clean and transform it, and load it into a SQLite database for further analysis.

*Tools Used*: Python (pandas, sqlite3, datetime), SQLite, CSV

*Approach*: Extracted a CSV dataset with missing timestamps and store names, applied transformation logic (imputed medians, parsed durations, renamed missing stores), and loaded the cleaned subset into a normalized SQLite table.

*Outcome*: Successfully created a cleaned and structured dataset with 443 rows â†’ verified against the raw input and loaded into a local database for future BI or SQL queries.

* **Soccer Team Clustering â€“ Unsupervised Analysis:**
Clustered 60 European football teams using hierarchical and K-Means algorithms to uncover performance-based groupings.

*Tools Used*: R (dplyr, cluster, factoextra, qgraph)

*Approach*: Scaled features, applied Wardâ€™s linkage and K-Means (k=4), and validated with silhouette and gap statistics.

*Outcome*: Identified 4 performance clusters with clear visual insights via dendrograms, cluster plots, and factor analysis.

* **California Housing Price Prediction â€“ Regression Models:**
Built predictive models to estimate median house values in California using cleaned census data, with preprocessing, model comparison, and tuning.

*Tools Used*: R (dplyr, caret, rpart, e1071, MASS, ggplot2)

*Approach*: Cleaned missing data, created engineered features, used stratified sampling, and applied multiple models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, SVM) with 10-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

*Outcome*: Best performance achieved with tuned Decision Tree & SVM models; evaluated using RMSE on both train and test splits.

* **HR Analytics Dashboard â€“ Tableau Visualization Project:**
Designed a comprehensive Tableau dashboard to explore employee demographics and workforce trends across departments and job roles.

*Tools Used*: Tableau, Excel (data source)

*Outcome*: Created an interactive HR analytics dashboard in Tableau combining multiple workforce KPIs (e.g., gender distribution, department-wise age/income, education field, attrition trends), enabling leadership to access actionable insights in one place and reducing manual reporting efforts by over 2 hours/week.

* **Smart Car Parking Detection using Deep Learning (CNN):**
Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify parking spots as **Occupied** or **Vacant**, using the **PKLot surveillance image dataset** and Google Colab training pipeline. Achieved **95.7% training accuracy** and **94.9% validation accuracy** after 5 epochs.

*Tools*: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Google Colab, Pandas, Matplotlib

*Model*: CNN (Conv2D + MaxPooling + Dense), compared with a baseline ANN

*Dataset*: 3,958 real-world surveillance images from the PKLot dataset

*Accuracy*: 95.7% (Train), 94.9% (Validation)
